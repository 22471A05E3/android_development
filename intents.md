# Activities and intents

#### Introduction

In this, you learn about the Activity class, the major building block of your app's user interface (UI). You also learn about using an Intent to communicate from one activity to another.


### About activities
* An activity represents a single screen in your app with an interface the user can interact with. For example, an email app might have one activity that shows a list of new emails, another activity to compose an email, and another activity for reading individual messages. Your app is probably a collection of activities that you create yourself, or that you reuse from other apps.

* Although the activities in your app work with each other to form a cohesive user experience, each activity is independent of the others. This enables your app to start an activity in another app, and it enables other apps to start activities in your app (if your app allows this). For example, a messaging app could start an activity in a camera app to take a picture, then start an activity in an email app to let the user share the picture in email.
