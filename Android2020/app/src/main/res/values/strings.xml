        Now we are learing android application development.Defination of Android is a platform,which consits of mobile oparating system based on linux kernal .This is a Google open source software\n
        In October 2003, Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White founded Android.inc  Palo Alto, California. The main intention of the company at the time was to build an advanced operating system for digital cameras. But soon the company realized that there is no big market for digital cameras and thus, they shifted their intention to develop Android as a mobile operating system. Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile were the main targets for them as rivals. But still, there were no investors for Android. A close friend of Rubin, Steve Perlman gave ten thousand dollars to him and this resulted in the growth of Android. It was in July 2005 that Google acquired Android for 50 million dollars. Most of its key employees, including few founders, also joined Google as part of the deal. The team at Google started working on Android with Rubin as the team lead. At the time, Google did not reveal much about its Android project.\n
        As of 2019, Android has an 86 percent share in the market of the smartphone operating system. Clearly, Android is the most used operating system in smartphones. Its only competitor in the smartphone operating system market now is Apple’s IOS. But Android is not that old. The first Android smartphone was launched in September 2008 and it did not take much time for Android to suppress all its rivals, except the IOS of course. In these years, a number of Android versions were released with better features that made it the top smartphone operating system. In this article, we will discuss the history of Android and the evolution it had. The android versions clearly had a role in the evolution of mobile apps.\n
