# Productivity Enhancement Tools
## Introduction to Productivity Enhancement Tools
* If you are working on your academic project with your friends(suppose 5 members). For preparing the reports and for editing, if you use pendrive or any offline sharing platforms, it will take so much time for sharing, because you have to meet your friend, then you will share the document. But if you use online sharing platforms if anyone among your friends are editing the document, it will be known to you on time.
* Sharing the files : We have many platforms to save and share the files online with one or more persons like - Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft oneDrive, Hightail etc..

* You can do a lot with a Google account these days, from using Google Drive to create and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations to using Google Maps to learn your way around.

* **Google** has created something truly remarkable with its Google Docs application suite.We've all used Microsoft Office or some other office productivity applications suite before but it's not like this. There are no applications to install or licenses to purchase. Google tools will help you improve your productivity of work.
        
* **RAPTOR** is a flowchart-based programming environment, designed specifically to help students visualize their algorithms and avoid syntactic baggage. RAPTOR programs are created visually and executed visually by tracing the execution through the flowchart. Required syntax is kept to a minimum.
