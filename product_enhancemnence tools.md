# Productivity Enhancement Tools
## Introduction to Productivity Enhancement Tools
* If you are working on your academic project with your friends(suppose 5 members). For preparing the reports and for editing, if you use pendrive or any offline sharing platforms, it will take so much time for sharing, because you have to meet your friend, then you will share the document. But if you use online sharing platforms if anyone among your friends are editing the document, it will be known to you on time.
* Sharing the files : We have many platforms to save and share the files online with one or more persons like - Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft oneDrive, Hightail etc..

* You can do a lot with a Google account these days, from using Google Drive to create and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations to using Google Maps to learn your way around.

* **Google** has created something truly remarkable with its Google Docs application suite.We've all used Microsoft Office or some other office productivity applications suite before but it's not like this. There are no applications to install or licenses to purchase. Google tools will help you improve your productivity of work.
        
* **RAPTOR** is a flowchart-based programming environment, designed specifically to help students visualize their algorithms and avoid syntactic baggage. RAPTOR programs are created visually and executed visually by tracing the execution through the flowchart. Required syntax is kept to a minimum.
  
## Hardware and Software Requirements:
- i3 or above Processor is required
- 2 GB RAM is recommended(Minimum)
- Good Internet Connectivity

## Google Mail (Using Gmail)

  #### Introduction to Gmail
   Gmail is a free email service provided by Google. In many ways, Gmail is like any other email service: You can send and receive emails, block spam, create an address book, and perform other basic email tasks. But it also has some more unique features that help make it one of the most popular online email services.**

   In this lesson, we'll talk about some of the features and advantages of Gmail, and we'll give an overview of the Gmail window.
   
   #### Google accounts

   Creating a Google account is needed to access Gmail because it is just one of the many services offered by Google to registered users. Signing up for a Google account is free and easy, and naming your new Gmail address will be a part of the sign-up process. This means whenever you're signed in to Gmail, you are automatically signed in to your Google account. You'll be able to easily access other Google services like Google Docs, Calendar, and YouTube.

Ofcourse, you don't have to use any of these features. You may just want to focus on email for now. However, if you'd like more information, you can review our Google account tutorial, where we talk about some of the different services Google offers and show you how to change your privacy settings.
   
   ### Gmail features
   Gmail offers several useful features to make your email experience as smooth as possible, including:

    -> Spam filtering. Spam is another name for junk email. Gmail uses advanced technologies to keep spam out of your inbox. Most spam is automatically sent to a separate spam folder, and after 30 days it is deleted.

    -> Conversation View. An email conversation occurs whenever you send emails back and forth with another person (or a group of people), often about a specific topic or event. Gmail groups these emails together by default, which keeps your inbox more organized.
    -> Built-in chat. Instead of sending an email, you can send someone an instant message or use the voice and video chat feature if your computer has a microphone and/or webcam.
    ->  Call Phone. This feature is similar to voice chat, except that it allows you to dial an actual phone number to call any phone in the world. It's free to make a call to anywhere in the United States or Canada, and you can make calls to other countries at relatively low rates.

   ### Get to know the Gmail interface

    When you're working with Gmail, you'll primarily be using the main Gmail interface. This window contains your inbox, and it allows you to navigate to your contacts, mail settings, and more. Also, if you use other Google services like YouTube or Calendar, you'll be able to access them from the top of the Gmail window.
