* If you are working on your academic project with your friends(suppose 5 members). For preparing the reports and for editing, if you use pendrive or any offline sharing platforms, it will take so much time for sharing, because you have to meet your friend, then you will share the document. But if you use online sharing platforms if anyone among your friends are editing the document, it will be known to you on time.
